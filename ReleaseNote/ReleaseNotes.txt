In this latest release, many of your favorite features are easier to use than before. We have added an advancement in the navigation bar in the shoe select screen. You will now be able to see a change in the button in the navigation bar when you add an item to a list. But this is short-lived for 3 seconds if there is no further action taking place, thus forcing the navigation bar to go back to its previous state. However, if you explicitly do a swipe down gesture to see the new state, then that state is retained. Hence making the navigation bar more intuitive to your actions. 

As we have always maintained, bugs may be a delicacy in many countries, but in your app, it's a no-no. So, we have removed a couple of semi-major bugs which silently crept in code to be finally detected and fixed.
